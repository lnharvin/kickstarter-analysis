# Discovering Trends with Kickstarter Analysis in Excel

## Overview of Project: 
Use Excel tools to analysis the kickstarter dataset and create visualization charts of that data.

### Purpose: 
To help Louise analysis the given data in hopes of launching a successful campaign in the United States.

## Analysis and Challenges
The kickstarter data is simple and easy to work with. Pivot tables and a line charts will be included in this analysis.

Using formulas was tricky. Double check your results on more than one row, by filtering the original dataset and verifying the values match before duplicating it's use. A simple typo in my formula caused me to waste time and produced false results, luckily it was on the first row and the value stuck out like a sore thumb from the others.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The most successful month to launch a campaign was in March. The worst was December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Campaigns with goals less than a $1K or in the range of $35,00 to $49,999 were successful with 67%-76% rates. There were no plays canceled at any goal range.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I've discovered that writing this final analysis just as difficult as formatting charts.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The month of May had the best rate for a successful campaign. The chance of having a play canceled was very low.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The only limitation I found was the data is at the mercy of the person analyzing the information. This is homework #1 so prayerfully my skills will proportionally increase for the lesson levels.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could have done a bar or scatter plot to compare the different subcategories within the theater parent category.
