Formatting charts is a lot more difficult than I imagined.

## Results

  It appears campaigns started in May are more successful.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Campaigns with goals less than a one thousand dollars and in the range of thirty-five thousand to forty-four nine hundred ninety-nine thousand were pretty successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data is at the mercy of the person analyzing the information.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could have done a bar or scatter plot to compare the different subcategories within the theater parent category.
